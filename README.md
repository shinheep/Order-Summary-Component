# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my [solution] (https://shinheep.github.io/Order-Summary-Component/) to the [Order summary card challenge] (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj) on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My Process

After building with only React for the past few months, I "challenged" myself to build a simple HTML and CSS front-end component by selecting this challenge. I mostly used Semantic HTML5, CSS custom properties, and Flexbox. Originally, I thought this challenge would take me at most one hour. However, this challenge forced me to remember some Flexbox properties that I hadn't used in a while and had forgotten. All in all, this challenge took me about 3 hours total.

Feel free to let me know if you see any issues, or a small detail that's not entirely like the example. I'm always open to feedback, and excited to learn!
