# Frontend Mentor - Order summary card

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my [solution](https://shinheep.github.io/Order-Summary-Component/) to the [Order summary card challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj) on Frontend Mentor. Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My Process

After building with only React for the past few months, I "challenged" myself to build a simple HTML and CSS front-end component by selecting this challenge. I mostly used Semantic HTML5, CSS custom properties, and Flexbox. Originally, I thought this challenge would take me at most one hour. However, this challenge forced me to remember some Flexbox properties that I hadn't used in a while and had forgotten. All in all, this challenge took me about 3 hours total. I had a lot of fun building this very simple, but humbling challenge, that also taught me some new tricks here and there.

Feel free to let me know if you see any issues, or a small detail that's not entirely like the example. I'm always open to feedback, and excited to learn!

## About Me

My name is Shinhee, and I am a full-stack software engineer creating modern and responsive design for the Web. My interest in web development started back in 2010 when I decided my Xanga page needed to have pretty stars flowing down the front page -- turns out that taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
Fast-forward to today, and I have just completed the Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp at Generaly Assembly, and I am proud to say my knowledge of programming goes beyond adding pretty stars to a website. With a detail-oriented approach to solving design and development problems, I focus on adding value to any team that I join. I utilize full-stack software solutions to create dynamic, high-quality user-focused solutions that deliver the best experience using the highest quality modern development methodology.

Apart from coding, I'm a proud dog and plant mom!
